# WavesDevKit for Javascript
Javascript development framework for Waves. Create transactions with Javascript, get the most used and needed Waves functions. 

# Why?

The WavesDevKit is a light version of the full Waves Wallet which was developed by Waves developers to work with the Waves API and JavaScript in the Waves Wallet.
Setup the server in waves.js (default localhost) to use your Nxt node, any transaction that will go through the wrapper will be signed with Javascript and then submitted to the Nxt API.
